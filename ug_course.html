                <h2>About the Department</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Civil Engineering is a professional engineering discipline deals with the design, execution, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, which includes public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports,
                        sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways. Civil Engineering is branched into a number of sub-disciplines.</li>
                    <li>It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering.</li>
                    <li>The basic needs of a human being such as quality air, potable water and shelter are being provided by a Civil engineer</li>
                    <li>A country’s infrastructure development is in the hands of a civil engineer. In our college, Civil engineering department was established in the year 2009.
                    </li>
                    <li>Civil Engineering program starts with basic principles of maths, physics and chemistry. We have well equipped laboratories to conduct research and consultancy works.</li>
